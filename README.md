The PyCitySchools.ipynb file analyzes district-wide standardized test results. 

Many trends can be seen in the data. Two of which are outlined below: 

1. Average reading scores tend to be higher than the average math scores, regardless of school. Additionally, average reading and math scores do not fluctuate much from 9th to 12th grade. Maybe senoritis isn't so real afterall?  

2. Large size schools (1000+) do not score as high on average compared to the middle and small size schools. One may imagine this is because in a large school students don't have as much individual attention. Interestly enough, as the per student budget increased, the average scores did not increase on average. Spending more money is not the answer to get better scores.
